    "### Gentle Intro to Numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy is another common library that we'll use quite a bit, it provides the data structure of an array, which will be much more useful later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we'll use several functions from numpy. Take a look at the \"mean\" function below - it does the exact same thing as the mean we used previously, the difference is that this one comes from the numpy package and the one we used last time comes from the pandas package. This does lead us into one common thing that can be confusing when we first start programming - where to put the function. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you recall from before, we got the mean by typing:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li> df[\"Height\"].mean()\n",
    "<li> Whereas now we are seeing...\n",
    "<li> np.mean(df[\"Height\"])\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "These two thing do the same thing, but they do it in different ways. Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, the ones we used last time, the \"mean\" function is \"part of\" the pandas library, i.e. it is literally a piece of code somewhere inside of the pandas files we are importing. More specifically, the mean function is (for lack of a better term) \"in\" the dataframe object. This will make more sense later on, but when you create objects (classes) when programming you can build them to store data (such as the dataframe sheet); you can also build them to have functionality - that is what the mean function, and the head function, etc... are. Because we are using something that is part of the dataframe object, we \"call it on\" that object, or\n",
    "\n",
    "> data_frame_object.Function_in_the_object_to_run(arguments)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the numpy ones we have here today it is a little different, we are using the mean function from numpy, which is not part of a dataframe. We are feeding it a dataframe as an input. So to call it we say...\n",
    "\n",
    "> library_name.which_function(data_to_use)\n",
    "\n",
    "The part before the period is where to look for the function, in the first it looks in the dataframe object, in the second it looks inside the numpy library. The part after the period is the function to find, in our case they are both the mean function. The arguments are additional data (or settings), for the first one we don't need anything else, as the function call already \"has\" the dataframe; in the numpy one we are calling a generic function, so in the argument we need to provide the data for it to use. This numpy function can do its mean calculation with many different types of inputs, so we can plug in a dataframe column, a series, an array, a list, etc... while still using one function.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is very common and we'll get used to it over time. As well, having a million ways to do things is very common - in this case using either is fine, but it can be easy to get mixed up, especially when you start, as you can see a million ways to do things. "

    "#### Standard Deviation 标准差\n",
    "\n",
    "Another measure of dispersion is the Standard Deviation - the square root of the Variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is normally used with normal distributions. If you remember all the z-score stuff from high school, that comes from this. When we are discussing dispersion the standard deviation is often more usable as it is on the same scale as the original data - the variance squares, the standard deviation takes it away. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can think back to some of that z-score stuff to picture exactly what the standard deviation shows - it tells us what share of values will be within X standard deviations of the mean. In a perfect normal distribution, ~68% of the results lie within 1 standard deviation of the mean, so with our data we can see that the 68% of NBA players are spread over a range of about 17.5cm (from -1 std to +1 std) centered at 197cm. With the NFL players those people are spread over a range of about 13cm. Intuitively this makes sense as there are way more basketball players that range into really large heights. \n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>\"The Empirical Rule states that 99.7% of data observed following a normal distribution lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean. Under this rule, 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation, 95% percent within two standard deviations, and 99.7% within three standard deviations from the mean.\"\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can expect about 68% of players to be between ~189 and ~206cm, about 95% to be between ~180 and ~215cm, and about 99.7% between ~171 and ~223cm - or about 7'3\"!!! This is assuming that our data is normal though - if you look at the two datasets, do you see any issues with that? <b>The closer our data is to a true normal distribution, the more accurate these estimates will be - this concept will become important in a few weeks.</b>\n",

    "#### Medians and Typical Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is one of our other \"averages\", representing the value in the middle - with 50% of other values falling above, and 50% falling below. The median is very commonly useful in real-world, population based measures such as income. The median is less impacted by outliers than the mean, so in a situation where there are a few billionaires with massive incomes dragging up the mean, the median will not follow much. In cases such as this the median is a better representitive of an \"average example\". \n",

    "In this example the IQR is the range between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile. It tells us the range of the middle 50% of records. So half of the NFL players are between about 183 and 190 cm, a range of only about 7 or 8 cm. The NBA IQR is from about 190 to 205, or about 15 cm. So the \"middle height\" players in the NBA are spread over a much wider range. \n",

    "\n",
    "There's another tool we can use to examine some distributions, a probability mass function (PMF). PMFs largely provide the same functionality as histograms, but they show probability instead of total count. E.g. for our example a histogram would show how many NBA players are 205cm tall, a PMF woudl show the probability a NBA player is 205cm tall. This is especially usefull when we have different total numbers. To demonstrate, try putting both the NBA and NFL histograms on one chart...\n",
